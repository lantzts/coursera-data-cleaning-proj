# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Projects

The purpose of this exercise is to create an R script that demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.  

Please see the [CODE-BOOK.md](./CODE-BOOK.md) for additional details of the data set and script.

**The 'run_analysis.R' script performs the following actions required to create the tidy data set:**
1. Initialize the data directory './data' and './data-zip'
2. Downloads the data to './data-zip' and unzips to './data'
3. Reads the data
4. Transforms and summarizes the data
5. Outputs an independent data set called 'tidy.txt'
